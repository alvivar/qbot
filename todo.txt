        TO DO


    Auto queue images and text from folder (file name as text)
    Auto queue text tweets from a simple file

    Bug A tweet was tweeted at 20:06 when it should have 20:50

    An option to ignore the application start datetime validation
    Current timer should be saved on the config file?

    Tweets with errors should return to the json watched file to be fixed
    Database should reflect tweets with errors instead of just mark them as published

    Bug? Watching -w a file fails when the folder name contains .
    qbot.json missing structure should regenerate on demand, this the only requirement for other scripts is to add the messages dictionary

    Detect and survive when there is no internet (ops)
    Try the next tweet if the current fails (this could be a problem when there is no internet)

    Tumblr support
    Bot option to print the session log
    Option to set a schedule to n posts between 2 hours
    Tweet more that once per run (configurable)

    Option to cascade delete a schedule
    Tokens should be inside the database?
    Implement logging instead of print (sexyness +1)
