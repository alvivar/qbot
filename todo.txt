        TO DO


    Database should reflect tweets with errors instead of just mark them as published
    Tweets with errors should return to the json config message file to be fixed

    Bot option to print the log
    Bot option to pause to scroll over the window
    Option to set a schedule to n posts between 2 hours

    QBot message option to auto queue images from folder (image name as text, image as image)

    Detect and survive when there is no internet
    Try the next tweet if the current fails (this could be a problem when there is no internet)

    Wait time should be exactly the time next for the next queue?
    Implement logging instead of print (sexyness +1)

    Option to cascade delete a schedule
    Tokens should be inside the database
    After starting, first hour to tweet should be the closest to current time, not the first one to the current hour, once?
    Tweet more that once per run (configurable)
