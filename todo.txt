        TO DO


    Rename repeat argument to delay
    Auto queue images and text from folder (file name as text)
    Auto queue text tweets from a simple file
    qbot.json missing structure should regenerate on demand, this the only requirement for other scripts is to add the messages dictionary
    Tumblr support

    Bug: Watching -w a file fails when the folder name contains .
    Detect and survive when there is no internet (ops)
    Database should reflect tweets with errors instead of just mark them as published
    Tweets with errors should return to the json watched file to be fixed
    Try the next tweet if the current fails (this could be a problem when there is no internet)

    Bot option to print the session log
    Option to set a schedule to n posts between 2 hours

    Wait time should be exactly the time next for the next queue?
    Implement logging instead of print (sexyness +1)

    Option to cascade delete a schedule
    Tokens should be inside the database
    After starting, first hour to tweet should be the closest to current time, not the first one to the current hour, once?
    Tweet more that once per run (configurable)
